# Ultimate NAS - DevOps Edition (in-development)

## About

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/DAVFoundation/api_doc.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas/blob/master/LICENSE)

This project draws inspiration from several other existing open source projects:

- [Perfect Media Server](https://perfectmediaserver.com/) - Open-source media server framework by [Alex Kretzschmar](https://github.com/ironicbadger), using Linux paired with [MergerFS](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs) (virtual, modular, configurable filesystem that allows for storage aggregation using different underlying filesystems) and [SnapRAID](http://www.snapraid.it/) (scriptable, self-healing software-based RAID targeted for home media centers) as an FOSS alternative for proprietary NAS solutions such as unRAID, OpenMediaVault, etc.
- [Ansible NAS](https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas) - NAS project by [David Stephens](https://github.com/davestephens), forking his project as the core Ansible deployment
- [Wolfgang's Home Server Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/notthebee/infra) - Ansible playbook for home server by Linux YouTuber [Wolfgang](https://www.youtube.com/c/WolfgangsChannel), pulling some application and config ideas from this project
- [DevOps Boilerplate Code](https://github.com/ChristianLempa/boilerplates) - Boilerplates for Terraform and Proxmox infrastructure deployments by [Christian Lempa](https://github.com/ChristianLempa)

## What Ultimate DevOps NAS Does

This intends to be a self-contained and automated provisioning and configuring of a feature-rich NAS host, with a flexible and modular configuration.

All services will be deployed via Ansible playbooks, with all services containerized with Docker.
The eventual goal is to migrate all services to Kubernetes (something for smaller-scale clusters like K3s, Minikube, etc.) at a later point.

There is complexity with this due to some services being stateful (any apps using a built-in SQLite DB like Sonarr, Jellyfin, etc.) or requiring sidecar pods (any apps requiring a separate DB container, such as Firefly, Gitea, NextCloud, etc.)

All services are meant to be optional and swappable with alternatives of one's choosing, as each service will be deployed with an Ansible playbook using `<SERVICE_NAME>_enabled` as a deployment variable.

Features include:

- Flexible storage and software-based RAID
- Front-end dashboard
  - Services Health Checks
  - Monitoring and Logging
- Home Automation dashboard
- Media server
  - Movies
  - TV Shows
  - eBooks
  - Comics/Manga
- Torrent management
  - Tracking
  - Auto Downloader
- Traefik Reverse Proxy
- Dynamic DNS
- Password Vault
- Private Cloud
  - File Storage
  - Photo Storage

Planned features include:
- End-to-end self-hosted CI/CD pipelines for deployment
  - Different environments for dev, staging and prod
- Using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm in place of just Docker
- Self-hosted MFA with Authelia
