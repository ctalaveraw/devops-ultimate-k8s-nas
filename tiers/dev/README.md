# "Development" environment

This will be used to host the `dev` version of this Ultimate NAS environment.

Both `dev` and `staging` will contain more up-to-date software.

However, `dev` will contain more debugging and bleeding edge components.

Once considered stable, changes will be promoted from `dev` --> `staging`.
