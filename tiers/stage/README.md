# "Staging" environment

This will be used to host the `staging` version of this Ultimate NAS environment.

Both `dev` and `staging` will contain more up-to-date software.

However, `staging` will be more tested than `dev`.

Once considered stable, changes will be promoted from `staging` --> `prod`.
